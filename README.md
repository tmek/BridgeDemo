# BridgeDemo
VR Starship Bridge Demo (Built with Unreal Engine 4 for Oculus DK1)

A lot of people have asked me to do a re-release for updated headsets but I never found the time to work on it so I'm releasing the source in case someone wants to give it some love. While it was a really fun personal project it is admittedly very poorly coded and was originally built with one of the very earliest versions of UE4 and C++. There are likely going to be issues but I updated the source enough so that it will build and open with Unreal Engine 4.21.1 and Visual Studio Community Edition.

While all of the source code for the original executable is included, much of it is currently commented out.  Including the voice recognition, Netflix capture and Wolfram/Alpha query and response code. Still, it is there if someone wants to try to get it updated and working again.

All content, such as textures and 3D models, were either created entirely by myself or used with permission from "CHAINSAW".  The source art assets have been included in ArtAssets.zip. There were a few audio clips from the TV series that were included in the original executable that have been removed to ensure this repository contains no copyrighted files.

Below is a video review of the demo by eVRydayVR back in 2014.
