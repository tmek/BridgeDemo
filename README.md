# BridgeDemo
VR Starship Bridge Demo (Built with Unreal Engine 4 for Oculus DK1)

A lot of people have asked me to do a re-release for updated headsets but I never found the time to work on it so I'm releasing the source in case someone wants to give it some love. While it was a really fun personal project it is admittedly very poorly made and was originally built with one of the very earliest versions of UE4 and C++. There likely going to be issues but I have update the source so that it will build and open with UE4 4.21.1 and Visual Studio Community Edition.

All of the source code for the original executable is included but the voice recognition, Netflix capture and Wolfram/Alpha query and response code has been commented out.  I doubt I'll have any spare time to attempt to fix these. Hopefully someone can give them some love and get it working again.

All art, such as textures and 3D models, were created by myself or used with permission from "CHAINSAW".  The source for the art assets has also been included ArtAssets.zip. The audio files of the TV series that were included in the original executable have been removed from this repository to ensure it contains no copyrighted files.

Below is a video review of the demo by eVRydayVR back in 2014.
