VR Starship Bridge Demo Built with Unreal Engine 4 for Oculus DK1

This was created years ago as a personal project to explore Unreal Engine and the Oculus DK1 VR Headset. 

While it was a really fun project it is admittedly very poorly made and was originally built with one of the very earliest versions of UE4. There likely going to be issues but it does build and open with UE4.21.1 and Visual Studio Community Edition.

All of the source code for the original executable is included but the voice recognition, Netflix capture and Wolfram/Alpha query and response code has been commented out.  I doubt I'll have any spare time to attempt to fix these. Hopefully someone can give them some love and get it working again.

All art, such as textures and 3D models, were created by myself or used with permission from "CHAINSAW".  The source for the art assets has also been included ArtAssets.zip

The audio files of the TV series that were included in the original executable have been removed from this repository to ensure it contains no copyrighted files.

Here is a video review of VR Bridge Demo back in 2014.
